# Decisions

The decisions in force: grepped and re-entered, never read front to back. A heading is the decision's ID alone,
so `DECISIONS.md#d3` keeps resolving after the wording is sharpened. Retired decisions, the journal and notes
from reviews live in [history/](history/).

**Before proposing a change in an area, read the Rejected lines of its decisions and the history they link to.**
Reopening a rejected option is right when its premise changed; repeating it without knowing it was rejected is
not.

## Q1

**Open: where the diff comes from — GitHub's ready-made patches, or computed in githq from the file before and
after.** Hiding whitespace changes (owner's requirement, remembered across pull requests) and exact scroll targets
(owner's complaint about github.com jumping to the wrong place) both depend on it. Agent leans towards computing it.

> **Checked 2026-11-02:** no GitHub API offers a whitespace-ignoring diff. Neither `GET …/pulls/{n}/files`,
> `GET …/pulls/{n}` with `application/vnd.github.diff`, nor `GET …/compare/{basehead}` (parameters: `basehead`,
> `page`, `per_page` only) lists one ([pulls](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls),
> [compare](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits#compare-two-commits)). Verdict from absence in the docs.

> **Checked 2026-11-02:** `GET …/pulls/{n}/files` — "Responses include a maximum of 3000 files", 30 per page by
> default, 100 at most; when `patch` is omitted is not documented (third-party reports: binary files and files
> over roughly 3,000 changed lines). The whole diff as `application/vnd.github.diff` has no documented size limit; a
> third-party report says it fails with 406 past 20,000 lines. Compare returns "up to 300 changed files"
> ([pulls/files](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests-files)).

> **Checked 2026-11-02:** GraphQL `PullRequestChangedFile` has `path`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changeType`,
> `viewerViewedState` and no diff text; `markFileAsViewed` / `unmarkFileAsViewed` exist
> ([GraphQL pulls](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/pulls)). File contents: GraphQL `Blob` has `text`
> ("null if the Blob is binary"), `byteSize`, `isBinary`, `isTruncated`, with no documented truncation threshold
> ([GraphQL git](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/git)). The REST contents API serves files up to 100 MB
> (raw media type above 1 MB). `api.github.com` and `raw.githubusercontent.com` both answered
> `access-control-allow-origin: *` to a live request with an `Origin` header (the latter undocumented, tried on a
> public file only).

## Q2

**Open: does the first version write a review (line comments, replies, resolving threads, approve / request
changes), or only read?** Agent recommends writing: reading here and commenting on github.com means finding the
same line twice.

> **Checked 2026-11-02:** GraphQL has `addPullRequestReview`, `addPullRequestReviewThread` (takes
> `pullRequestReviewId`: "Adds a new thread to a pending Pull Request Review"), `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply`,
> `submitPullRequestReview` ("Submits a pending pull request review"), `resolveReviewThread`,
> `deletePullRequestReview`; `PullRequestReviewState.PENDING` exists. That leaving out `event` creates a pending
> review is common knowledge, not documented. `PullRequestReviewThread` carries `path`, `line`, `startLine`,
> `originalLine`, `diffSide`, `startDiffSide`, `isOutdated`, `isResolved`, `subjectType` (`LINE` | `FILE`); each
> comment carries `diffHunk` ([GraphQL pulls](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/pulls)).

> **Checked 2026-11-02:** stacked pull requests expose no stack-level diff; each pull request shows "only the diff
> for its layer" ([about stacked PRs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/get-started/about-stacked-prs)).
